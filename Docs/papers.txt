(kindly provided by Alberto Raposo)
notes:
~ sequence of points define curve -> interpolated with Catmull-Rom splines
~ points are sent to GPU, geometry created in hull-shader/tessellator/domain-shader
~ approx the curve with linear segments, adaptively adds more segments in regions with large derivatives
~ LOD reduces only cross-section vertex count down to three (triangular cross-section)
~ radius is scaled up over distance to reduce aliasing 
	~> apparently no MSAA is used in addition but AA is supposedly eliminated (?)
	~> also no opacity reduction applied when reaching sub-pixel diameters
~ benchmark compares the tessellator-approach to a naive one where the geo is generated on CPU and send to GPU
	~> strongly reduced banwidth requirements
~ AA approach (scaling radius) is compared to no AA (benchmark in fps *sigh*)
	~> nearly no fps drop
	

- Rendering Generalized Cylinders using the A-Buffer
link: http://www.neulander.org/work/thesis.pdf
notes:
~ dynamic adaptive screne-space tessellation of curves with varying radii
~ using an A-Buffer for AA purposes
~ positions und radii are interpolated using cubic splines (Catmull-Rom)
~ other properties like color, opacity, reflectance are linearly interpolated

notes:

~ approaches to numerically solve 4th and 6th degree equations are required to directly ray-cast quadratic and cubic splines, respectively

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6562867/specialised-algorithm-to-find-positive-real-solutions-to-quartic-equations :
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand%E2%80%93Kerner_method (looks simple and nice, might do ~> nope, it doesnt :(, req too many iterations
 which makes it way too slow, and still doesnt find the roots in some cases)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins%E2%80%93Traub_algorithm (probably too heavy for shaders (https://github.com/sweeneychris/RpolyPlusPlus))
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method (very simple, too many problems)

- different idea: binary search between local extrema where one extremum is positiv and one negative; 
		  requires the extrema to be given -> can be determined by root finding on the derivatives, 
		  analytically for 2nd degree or same approach applied again
		  -> doesnt that converge exponentially?
		  -> is there a name for this approach?
		  - there is also no need to search for all roots, just those relevant for the (potential) front (or back) intersections

~ analytic evaluation of the discriminant of a 4th degree equation turns out to be numerically instable (and also quite heavy), 
need other early-out criterium like rasterized proxy geo (non trivial to ensure that the spline is fully enclosed, 
also not nice for non-primary rays)
~ no discriminant available for cubic spline (6th degree poly) -> can the existance of roots be determined differently?
