notes:

~ approaches to numerically solve 4th and 6th degree equations are required to directly ray-cast quadratic and cubic splines, respectively
- http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/3202/solution-of-quartic-equation (stable quadratic roots)
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6562867/specialised-algorithm-to-find-positive-real-solutions-to-quartic-equations :
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand%E2%80%93Kerner_method (looks simple and nice, might do)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins%E2%80%93Traub_algorithm (probably too heavy for shaders (https://github.com/sweeneychris/RpolyPlusPlus))
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method (very simple, too many problems)

- different idea: binary search between local extrema where one extremum is positiv and one negative; 
		  requires the extrema to be given -> can be determined by root finding on the derivatives, 
		  analytically for 2nd degree or same approach applied again
		  -> doesnt that converge exponentially?
		  -> is there a name for this approach?
		  - there is also no need to search for all roots, just those relevant for the (potential) front (or back) intersections

~ analytic evaluation of the discriminant of a 4th degree equation turns out to be numerically instable (and also quite heavy), 
need other early-out criterium like rasterized proxy geo (non trivial to ensure that the spline is fully enclosed, 
also not nice for non-primary rays)
~ no discriminant available for cubic spline (6th degree poly) -> can the existance of roots be determined differently?

~ having a ray-casting routine at hand, implementing a specular transmission/reflection model with ray-tracing would be nice...
